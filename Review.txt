I like the plan. It seems straightforward and similar to other games which we can use as a starting point, but with a twist that people will  like. 
I like the POV idea. 

I want to know how the different roles will work. Will you command staff or work one job with AI working the other?  Or will you do everything? I think a multiplayer element would be cool but singleplayer options would be good as well

Chatty teacher thing is really funny and so real

The video is good and informative. You cleared up a couple of questions I had in the video.

Overall I really like the idea. I've made games before and i'm excited at the prospect of making this thing.
