STRENGTHS:
- I love the replayability and collaborative aspects of your game! It has this "Papa's Pizzarea" in class vibe, except with a more personal aspect that I def think HW students would enjoy

- I also really love the thought you've already put into other minigames / possible mechanics within the game. It's already really well thought out, and I can already see how the game will progress in difficulty while still keeping it engaging for the player!


QUESTIONS:
- If you mess up a dish, can you still serve it? How does this affect the cafeteria?

- with the specific roles, I'm a little confused on if they're allowed to like move jobs & roles. For example, w/overcooked anyone can really do any job-- would this game operate the same way or is it more specialized with roles? what would the "cashier" people doing while the chefs are prepping all the meals? -- or maybe diff staff are just better at different things.
	--> this also concerns me a bit because with more locked-down roles it may end up more repetitive for the player, i.e. if you're on cashier job the whole time then it might start getting redundant or too easy. I would love to find a way to sort of force people to switch roles a lot more to keep the player engaged (which will add an extra challenge of navigating through the horde of kids haha)

- how would communication w/other players work in the game?


FEEDBACK/IDEAS:
- I feel like right now the mechanics are definitely super fun, though I still feel like there's missing a "personal" aspect of it, like how could you make it feel more HW?

- Maybe character picker w/different stats for how good they are at stuff (though not sure how that would effect minigame playing)

- A popularity system along w/the money would be cool!! For example, if you make a bad dish then kids will be more upset & your at risk for getting in trouble? this would also apply to if kids were slipping in caf, food wasn't stocked, i.e.

-an investment system to upgrade your cafeteria would be awesome, which could be used to introduce new mechanics & actually use the money ur making (although it is technically HW)

- some of the minigames involving interacting w/npcs (teacher convos and student fights) had very "black and white" options in terms of the interactions the player can do (like, be mean vs be nice). I would love to see how personality type effects the response that you should give people.
