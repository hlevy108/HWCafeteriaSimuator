co-op style:
- Max # of people collaborating?
- If someone is in one role but another group is struggling, are you allowed to help out? or are you locked into your role from the start? -- esp for the cooking part which feels like the main gameplay
- assuming different computer screens -- just specify that
- How does communication work?? Is it voice chat? what options will there be for people without mics? 

Cooking:
- same idea, does EVERY role participate in the cooking prep or is it only the dedicated "cooks?"
- What constitutes "poor prep?" in what ways can you mess up a dish, and if you mess it up can you still serve it?

Minigames:
- currently the minigames involving talking (w/teachers or breaking up student fights) are kinda black & white with a "good" versus a "bad" response. maybe there can be a system based on student/teacher type that needs you decide what tone to say based on the teacher personality?
- The spill thing seems w students slipping seems cool, I would love to see how that can be expanded on-- do students slipping cause a holdup in the line? is there a popularity ranking based on how well your doing?

Will there be like an investment system?? like if you collect enough money can you get more devices or auto-helper stuff?? how do you plan on increasing difficulty while having the same functions (aka, is it different skills? do you unlock different games? faster = harder yes would you gradually unlock regions or new minigames to keep player engaged?

would love to see a final boss haha
